<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

An R package for working with models in survival analysis in which the distribution is
parameterized by a very flexible failure rate function (any function that satisfies properties like
being non-negative, integrating to infinity over the domain, and having a support of `(0, Inf)`.
