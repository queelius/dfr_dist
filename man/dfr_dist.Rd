\title{Constructor for \code{dfr_dist} objects}
\usage{
dfr_dist(
  rate,
  par = NULL,
  eps = 0.01,
  ob_col = "t",
  delta_col = "delta",
  cum_haz_rate = NULL,
  score_fn = NULL
)
}
\arguments{
\item{rate}{A function that computes the hazard rate at time \code{t}.}

\item{par}{The parameters of the distribution. Defaults to \code{NULL},
which means that the parameters are unknown.}

\item{eps}{The epsilon update for numerical integration. Defaults to 0.01.}

\item{ob_col}{The column name for observation times in data frames.
Defaults to "t".}

\item{delta_col}{The column name for event indicators in data frames.
Uses standard survival analysis convention: 1 = event
observed (exact), 0 = right-censored. Defaults to "delta".}

\item{cum_haz_rate}{Optional analytical cumulative hazard function H(t, par).
If provided, enables exact AD-based gradient computation.
Should return the integral of rate from 0 to t.}

\item{score_fn}{Optional analytical score function score(df, par).
If provided, enables exact AD-based Hessian computation
via Jacobian of the score. Should return gradient vector.}
}
\value{
A \code{dfr_dist} object that inherits from \code{likelihood_model}.
}
\description{
We assume that the hazard rate is a function of time and any other
predictors. We also assume that integrate(rate(t), 0, Inf) = infinity
and that the support is (0, Inf).
