Description: Flexible framework for specifying survival distributions through
    their hazard (failure rate) functions. Define arbitrary time-varying
    hazard functions to model complex failure patterns including bathtub
    curves, proportional hazards with covariates, and other non-standard
    hazard behaviors. Provides automatic computation of survival, CDF, PDF,
    quantiles, and sampling. Implements the likelihood model interface for
    maximum likelihood estimation with right-censored survival data.
